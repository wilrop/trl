        If we have process A and process B called `torch.distributed.init_process_group`
        to form a group, and then we want to form another group with process A, B, C,
        D, it is not possible in PyTorch, because process A and process B have already
        formed a group, and process C and process D cannot join that group. This
        function is a workaround for this issue.

        `torch.distributed.init_process_group` is a global call, while this function
        is a stateless call. It will return a `StatelessProcessGroup` object that can be
        used for exchanging metadata. With this function, process A and process B
        can call `StatelessProcessGroup.create` to form a group, and then process A, B,
        C, and D can call `StatelessProcessGroup.create` to form another group.
